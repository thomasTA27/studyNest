This is what the showcase site should look like initially.

You can:
- Hover over the blue bar to reveal the sample widgets
  - ![Sample Widgets](https://github.com/HackMelbourne/Hackiethon25/blob/d641575faedee4c85f1fea4ffe5cc9d5b120dc64/showcase-site/screenshots/sampleWidgets.png)
- Hover over the purple bar to reveal the widget you will make (for now, a blank widget is in its place)
  - ![Submission Widgets](https://github.com/HackMelbourne/Hackiethon25/blob/d641575faedee4c85f1fea4ffe5cc9d5b120dc64/showcase-site/screenshots/submissionWidget.png)
- Drag a widget when the bar is revealed onto the website
- Drag a widget rendered on the website to the trash zone (red overlay at the bottom of the page) to remove it


You can change the background website to any of your choosing, by:
- Opening showcase-site/src/App.jsx
- Changing the website in line 10 to any website link
- Note: some websites won't work due to CSP protections
